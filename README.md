### Deploying OpenVPN on Linode

This guide will help you set up an OpenVPN server on a Linode instance running Ubuntu, enabling secure connections through a VPN.

---

#### Step 1: Deploy a Linode with Ubuntu
1. Log in to your Linode account.
2. Create a new Linode and choose **Ubuntu** as your operating system.
3. Select a data center, plan, and configure the instance according to your needs.
4. Once deployed, make a note of your Linodeâ€™s IP address.

#### Step 2: Update Your Server
1. Access your Linode via SSH:
   ```bash
   ssh root@your_linode_ip
   ```
2. Update and upgrade the packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

#### Step 3: Download the OpenVPN Installation Script
Download the OpenVPN install script provided by angristan:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh
   ```

#### Step 4: Make the Script Executable
1. Set the necessary permissions to run the script:
   ```bash
   chmod 777 openvpn-install.sh
   ```

#### Step 5: Run the OpenVPN Install Script
1. Start the OpenVPN installation script:
   ```bash
   ./openvpn-install.sh
   ```

#### Step 6: Accept Default Options
1. Press **Enter** to go with the default options as prompted during the setup process.

#### Step 7: Name the Client
1. When asked, name the client profile (for example, **Atlanta**).

#### Step 8: Transfer the Configuration File
1. Once the installation completes, a configuration file will be created for your client. The file is typically saved as `Atlanta.ovpn` in the server.
2. Copy the configuration file to your local machine. You can use `scp`:
   ```bash
   scp root@your_linode_ip:/root/Atlanta.ovpn ~/Atlanta.ovpn
   ```

#### Step 9: Install an OpenVPN Client Locally
1. On your local machine, download and install the OpenVPN client:
   - For **Windows**: [Download OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/)
   - For **macOS**: Install through [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/)
   - For **Linux**: Install via package manager, e.g., `sudo apt install openvpn` for Debian/Ubuntu.

#### Step 10: Connect Using Your VPN
1. Open your OpenVPN client and import the `Atlanta.ovpn` file.
2. Connect to the VPN by selecting the imported configuration file.
3. You are now connected to the internet securely through your VPN server.

Your OpenVPN server is now ready on Linode, and your device can connect through the VPN for secure internet access.
